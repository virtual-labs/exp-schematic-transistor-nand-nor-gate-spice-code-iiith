1. Write a complete SPICE netlist for a 2-input NAND gate and simulate its operation for all input combinations.

2. Write a complete SPICE netlist for a 2-input NOR gate and verify its truth table through simulation.

3. Compare the output waveforms of NAND and NOR gates when the same input signals are applied.

4. Using the NAND and NOR gates designed above, create SPICE code for XOR and XNOR gates.

5. Analyze and explain the power consumption difference between NAND and NOR gate implementations.
